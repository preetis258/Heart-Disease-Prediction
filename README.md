# Heart-Disease-Prediction \
## Introduction \
The term 'heart disease' refers to various conditions related to heart. Coronary artery disease (CAD), which impairs the blood flow to the heart, 
is the most prevalent kind of heart disease. It can lead to heart attack since there is a reduced flow of blood. \

## Problem statement \
To determine whether or not a person has heart disease. \ 

## Data: \
* The dataset consists of 272 individuals data. There are 14 columns in the dataset, which are described below. * \
Information about the columns: \
1. sex: sex (1 = male; 0 = female)
2. age: age in years
3. cp: chest pain type
4. trestbps: resting blood pressure
5. chol: serum cholestoral in mg/dl
6. fbs: (fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl) (1 = true; 0 = false)
7. restecg: resting electrocardiographic results
8. thalach: maximum heart rate achieved
9. exang: exercise induced angina (1 = yes; 0 = no)
10. oldpeak = ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest
11. slope: the slope of the peak exercise ST segment
12. ca: number of major vessels (0-3) colored by flourosopy
13. thal: 3 = normal; 6 = fixed defect; 7 = reversable defect
14. target: have disease or not (1=yes, 0=no)
